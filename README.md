# ECE342 Electronics II

This repository contains coursework and design work for **ECE342: Electronics II** at The Cooper Union, instructed by **Professor Neveen Shlayan** (Fall 2025). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Course Overview

Electronics II emphasizes analog integrated-circuit design using MOSFET and BJT building blocks, with focus on biasing, small-signal modeling, frequency response, and multistage amplifier design in modern IC processes. 

## Topics

- DC biasing and small-signal models (MOS and BJT) 
- Frequency response and stability considerations 
- Differential pairs and multistage amplifiers 
- Current mirrors and active loads 
- Operational-amplifier building blocks

## Projects

### [Final Project: Single-Balanced Active Mixer Core](./Final%20Project/ "Read More")

An RF-to-IF active mixer core simulated in an IC flow, demonstrating frequency translation
$\,f_{\mathrm{IF}} = |f_{\mathrm{LO}} - f_{\mathrm{RF}}|\,,$ conversion gain behavior, and operating-point verification of MOSFET saturation.
